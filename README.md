# dockerized DNS over HTTPS using pi-hole through cloudflared proxy-dns

adapted from https://visibilityspots.org/dockerized-cloudflared-pi-hole.html and his neat [cloudflared container](https://github.com/visibilityspots/dockerfile-cloudflared)

For administration and configuration see CjKâ€™s Admin Handbook.

## Getting started

1. Optionally add / modify pi-hole configuration / dnsmasq-config in the directories `./config/pihole` or `./config/dnsmasq`.
2. Bring both containers the docker network up: `docker-compose up -d`
